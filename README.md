# Super Resolution Project

This is a project for my Deep Learning class. In this prjoect, the Image Super-Resolution Using Deep Convolutional Networks paper is followed to handle super resolution problems using Python and Keras. 
Two datasets, a 91-image set and CelebA, are used as our training data. The data is preprocessed into low-resolution training data and high-resolution ground truth. 
By optimizing a CNN model with MSE to measure loss, the optimized model can map the low-resolution input to high-resolution reconstructed images.
